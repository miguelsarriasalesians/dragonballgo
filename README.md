# DRAGON BALL GO

Dragon Ball Go is an application that resembles the popular mobile game Pokemon Go.

The objective in this game is to find all the dragon balls. To get all of them you will have to find the QR codes and scan them.

This project was developed for Educational Purposes and to explore the possibilities of the Flutter Framework with my colleagues. My teammate worked on the API and I worked on the Frontend making the UI's and widgets.

## Roadmap

We were able to develop what was planned on time, and we used the extra time to add more functionalities and improve the app.
